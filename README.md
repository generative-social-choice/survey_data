# Generative Social Choice Open Datasets

This repo contains survey data collected as part of the project *Generative Social Choice* ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01291), [general audience report](https://procaccia.info/GenSoc_OpenAI_report.pdf)). To experimentally test our framework, we conducted two pilot studies:

* A study on U.S. public opinion regarding **chatbot personalization**, as part of [OpenAI's "Democratic Inputs to AI" grant program](https://openai.com/index/democratic-inputs-to-ai-grant-program-update/). This data was collected in November 2023. This data can be found in `data/chatbot_personalization_survey.csv`.
* A study on U.S. public opinion regarding **abortion**, to test our framework on a topic that is part of mainstream political discourse. This data was collected in August 2024. This data can be found in `data/abortion_survey.csv`.

Each dataset consists of 200 survey responses: 100 from a *generation survey*, in which we ask participants to flesh out their opinion on the topic in detail, and 100 from a *validation survey*, in which we ask participants to rate their agreement with LLM-generated statements on the topic on a multiple-choice scale. For more details, see [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01291) (v2 for chatbot personalization, v3 for abortion).
