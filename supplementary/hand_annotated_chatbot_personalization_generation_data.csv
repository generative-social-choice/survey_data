anonymized_user_id,privacy,consent,accuracy,harm
generation1,Most people generally just allow companies to track information and data without actually reading the consent,I think any time there should be an opt in/out option upon chatbot startup,,
generation2,A drawback to personalization in this example is not knowing how or if sensitive health data is stored and protected,to opt in for chatbot personalization a user has to be at least 18,,
generation3,,,,
generation4,The strongest argument would be a privacy issue,"As far as personal information like health, the bot should be told right up front to collect or not collect this information. When it filters for health related items, it should ask the user if they want items filtered out. The chatbot would need to follow the protocol or setup agreement with the user no matter what",,
generation5,privacy would be the clear answer for me.,"On the other hand, the ability to select a privacy level would be awesome. Or at the end of a conversation, a ""save"" option for future use, or a delete option would be perfect",I also do not think anything that would be considered harmful or illegal should be allowed,
generation6,,Personalization based on a user's browser history outside of the chat is only allowed with the user's consent,,Chatbot will emphasize the harm in such behaviors if the subject comes up.
generation7,"privacy is the main concern of most people, especially with AI",No collecting personal information unless the user consents to it fully upfront,Feeding into confirmation bias by providing news sources that support someone's political views would prevent them from having a fully objective view,personalization also carries the risk of causing harm
generation8,That somehow Chat Bots would amass a huge amount of information about you and (because it is just digital information) that information could be accessed by bad actors who will exploit it for their nefarious purposes.,"An ""Add this to my profile"" or Do not add this to my profile"" button.",,
generation9,this could be seen as a privacy issue,,"chatbot should not ever be allowed to draw from sources/report news from publications that are regarded as untrustworthy or frequently engage in ""fake news""",
generation10,It would keep some information private,The chatbots would have the option of what information the user wants the chatbot to remember.,,
generation11,giving personal info might lead to a security breach and your info would be public,,,Chatbox should not give personalized answers that relate to any illegal activity
generation12,,,,
generation13,extremely clear cut issue of privacy,,,"could be used to arrest and persecute the individual who is seeking to find an underground church in China, where churches are forbidden. It would put their life at risk"
generation14,,I would make rules that are toggle-able per user preferences. Some of the rules could be: Personalize Answers,,
generation15,A trade-off is that personal information is stored and maybe accessed for other purposes,,,
generation16,The drawback is giving too much information to the chatbot could be abused by the chatbot or if someone hacked into the chatbot,,,The chatbot should not give any answer that might do any harm to people is the number one rule
generation17,The information that the chatbot has about the user could also create privacy issues,,the personalization leads to some bias and lack of perspective,"like if the chatbot supports a user's idea that they don't have to stop at a stop sign when driving, this would lead to them not driving properly and this would be dangerous."
generation18,"It would be very important for me that anything involving my children was excluded from these rules. I do not share info about my children with anyone, nor do I share about them online. That is strictly private",I think there should be a large set of rules that the bot can follow and then the individual would have the ability to turn on or off compliance with those rules regarding personalization. No two people will want the same level of personalization,,
generation19,"the chatbot would be keeping track of everywhere the person goes, which could be used improperly by a company or other person","The person (user) must always have the choice of whether or not to allow an AI chatbot system to ""remember"" certain information.",,
generation20,Personalized chatbots can be a severe privacy and security concern,,,
generation21,Do you want to give up that privacy for some convenience? I,"automatic opt out starting point with the ability to add ""tools"", features and supposed benefits as per the users explicit approval",,
generation22,,,The rules would be that they can not censor information based on biased programming.,
generation23,I would be concerned with my privacy,give the option to listen to a basic answer or a personalized answer,,
generation24,this information could be accessed by other people and used against you,,,"The main rule would be not to suggest or go along with any sort of self-harm, harm of others, or harm of animals"
generation25,blocking AI chatbots from taking sensitive information,,have a high probability of being biased against minorities and other marginalized groups,
generation26,,,"results\answer about news, history, and basic facts are unvarnished truth - not personalized",
generation27,,,,Never prescribe or suggest any medication. This is the job of a qualified professional.
generation28,loss of privacy to obtain more personalized information,,"They should give answers about simple, factual items, without bias",
generation29,This would violate her privacy over what is probably is misunderstanding,,,"Being careful not to accidentally show somebody with growing white-power ideas the guild to improvised munitions, for an extreme"
generation30,,,"The principle that lies behind all of my rules is truth. A chatbot is a tool, and our tools owe it to us to present the truth. My scale owes me my correct weight, even if I am not happy with that weight. My camera owes me a true picture of myself, and if I am not happy with it, I can put on makeup and redo it, apply filters, or whatever, but I should be the one fudging the truth, not the tool.",Chatbots should ask questions that would help them avoid harmful acts
generation31,"In setting rules, we must always err on the side of caution, preserving privacy considerations to the best of our ability",,avoiding providing false or misleading information,not responding to requests for assistance with anything illegal
generation32,,Personalization should be always be optional for every seperate session.,,"However, with the chatbot saving past information, if the abuser came across this search, it could put the victim at risk"
generation33,,,That this would provide an option to be unbiased and consistent with answers which is most important,
generation34,A drawback would be if you had your personal information with the chatbot and someone was able to hack into it,,,
generation35,,,Any more than that and chatbots would be giving biased information that is believed to be better for the users when in fact it very well could not be,
generation36,We all value our privacy,,,
generation37,The chatbot shouldn't use any sensitive information,,,
generation38,,,The draw-backs would be that providing personalized to the user information could also restrict or bias the quality of the content,
generation39,"I would make sure that chatbots respect the users' preferences, privacy, and consent","I would make sure that chatbots respect the users' preferences, privacy, and consent","should not use personalized answers to manipulate, deceive, or harm the users in any way",
generation40,,,"By concentrating on the specific area only, user is denied the knowledge of important information that can have a negative or positive affect",
generation41,,,,I do not think chatbox's should provider personalized chats when users are requesting information regarding health or serious issues that could cause harm
generation42,,,,
generation43,it would feel invasive,the choice of opting out of all types of chatbot personalization,being manipulated by advanced AI to buy things or for propaganda purposes,
generation44,,I would address it by saying it is way too open and dangerous not to give alternate options and let the user decide,answers would be biased,
generation45,,,drawbacks such as being biased,
generation46,question of privacy concerns,,,there should not be personalized answers when someone is going to harm themselves or harm others
generation47,My strongest argument would be for user privacy,,,
generation48,No remembering previous information when it comes to health. No recommendations based on previous health information provided or requested,,". 1. All info will be presented in a neutral view. Facts only, unless certain opinion is requested",
generation49,,,,The main rule I can think of is chatbots not giving medical advice. I think that can be dangerous to users.
generation50,,"I Prefer it should be user choice, When the AI and humans are paired up they will try to understand the boundaries of the user preference and act that way",search in a limited way that I may leave out many new topics,
generation51,,,,A chatbot cant tell anyone to do anything that would hurt them. A chatbot cant tell anyone to do anything that would hurt anything else.
generation52,,he user can choose for themself whether they want to receive personalized answers. If I had to convince others to allow toggling personalization on/off,compromise the accuracy of the information they are able to provide,
generation53,,,people more susceptible to misinformatio,
generation54,,,If I'm going to ask a chatbot a question I want facts not something to just make me feel better,
generation55,it also places the privacy of the user and their information at risk,"personalization can only be achieved through information actively given to the chatbot by the user, not from collecting online data or other information that is not voluntarily given to the chatbot itself",,
generation56,,,,
generation57,,,,"there should be limits on just how personlized they can be, so they cant push someone over the line."
generation58,"can involve retaining a lot of data about their users to maintain that level of personalization, which can be a risk to the user's privacy",Chatbots should ask whether the user wants certain information to be stored for future use*,,"The user may seek unnecessary medical treatment and incur unnecessary costs, or do something else drastic."
generation59,,,,AI could do harm to a person by giving them inappropriate medical advice
generation60,this can raise privacy concerns for users,Chatbots must obtain consent from users before personalizing their responses,bias: Personalized chatbots can be biased if they are trained on data that is biased,Chatbots should not give personalized answers: When collecting personal data about the user's health or finances. When making decisions about whether or not to approve a loan or insurance policy. When making decisions about whether or not to hire someone. When providing advice about sensitive topics
generation61,what kind of laws exist about privacy,,I worry about how specific it could get or misleading,"What if a chatbot told someone their symptoms sounded like cancer, or that they should take the wrong kind of medication?"
generation62,the chatbot should adhere to data privacy and keep it anonymized,"My strongest argument would be that transparency, consent, and data privacy rules help build and maintain user trust",How can bias be minimized while trying to be personalized,
generation63,,I think personalizing the chatbot should be an option the user can turn on or off,chatbot would cater answers to please you which isn't impartial no,
generation64,User data protection has become a bit of a hot target issue,,Facebook tailored biased and false news towards people in lieu of the 2016 election,
generation65,there is a real threat of personal info leak,,,"no illegal advice in any sense, chat bots are not here to help aid illegal activity"
generation66,,should also be an opt-in choice instead of just the default,"AI chatbots should be as impartial and unbiases as possible, otherwise it just turns into a new form of propaganda",
generation67,"Personalization with AI chatbots is touchy, because who else gets this information?",,,
generation68,may led to the violation of the user's privacy,,,chatbots should not give information where users can harm either themselves or others
generation69,The overriding rule would be to always avoid infringing on the user's privacy and making assumptions,The chatbot might give the user the option at the beginning of every conversation to include previous data or not,,
generation70,My rules are mostly based on privacy,My main rules have to do with the option to stay anonymous.,,
generation71,,,accusations of misinformation,
generation72,but at the potential cost of privacy,,,
generation73,,,"ISomeone might claim that giving the user only their ideological viewpoints is best, when in fact finding the truth is what matter to make informed decisions.",
generation74,,Chatbot should ONLY use infomation that has been specifically mentioned by the user as information that the user would like to have saved for future conversations.,I believe the freedom of misinformation outright lies are a underlying causes of much misery today and that limiting that sort of information would be a good thing,"Chatbot should never personalize medical information, ever. There is so much misinformation available to bots that this could create a disasterous outcome"
generation75,,We keep control as humanity if we expand resources while giving individuals the chance to opt in or out of what they are alright with using.,,
generation76,Customers should feel safe their privacy will be protected and not be used without their permission,,Chatbots should not give any personized answer when the information is not completely factual or safe,
generation77,"Some users may be uncomfortable with a chatbot having access to their personal data, potentially raising privacy concerns",Explicit User consent: Users' explicit consent is a prerequisite for chatbots to personalize responses,(avoiding discrimination and bias),"(Personalization may lead to misunderstandings or misinterpretations of students' needs, especially when data is incomplete or outdated)"
generation78,,,a drawback would be the chatbot tailoring information in such a way that it reinforced faulty beliefs or gave unsafe or false information,"I'd want to have the chatbot avoid certain topics that include violence or abuse, bullying, racism, extremist beliefs, and so on"
generation79,user my feel uncomfortable with the chatbot knowing such personal information and other people being able to somehow gain access to it.,,,They should not give answers that would be harmful to others.
generation80,,,can affect the accuracy of answers from the chatbot,
generation81,,I think chat box should give user permission to what they want whether their personal information should be used,chatbox may mislead the user due to the previous answer making its credibility questioned,
generation82,you lose privacy to some degree and potentially security,Nothing should be totally redacted without the user's consent,misinformation or redacted information for someone else's agenda can be a dangerous thing,
generation83,,,,
generation84,this would help protect a persons privacy,,"Always tell the truth, no matter what",
generation85,The negative part would be compiling immense amounts of personal data that could then be used for unknown purposes or misused in harmful ways,,,"Similar to Asimov's laws of robotics, chatbots must not do harm or create a situation where harm can be done"
generation86,personal information can be stolen,,,My strongest argument against my rules would be security
generation87,,,,
generation88,increasingly willing to sacrifice their privacy for simple luxuries like listening to music,Chatbots should disclose financial and political ties so that any marketing of consumer data is able to be opted-in or out of,"If my parents were gifted a chatbot and didn't know it was collecting their personal information, they might be swayed by the AI into making purchases or decisions they otherwise would not have made",
generation89,Chatbots given all this personal information to personalize them is a dangerous thing. They could be hacked and place you in danger of people using this information for their gain,,"This way, truth and accuracy is ensure and feelings do not get in the way.",
generation90,,,"Wired magazine had a report after the 2020 election detailing how personalization/AI, algorithms etc. were used to have overt and negative affects on voting practices...with the general public being unaware even as they particpated",
generation91,How can I keep user's safe? How can we store and use this personalized information safely?,,,"It would have a bunch of personal information that could harm a user in many ways, like telling a user to drink a tea that's harmful while the user is on certain medications."
generation92,personal preferences and privacy are also a concern,"If the option to store information from a user is given, then things like health should be personalized to help them catch any illnesses or afflictions early","History should never be changed to suit a user just as news itself should also not be catered to a user to better help give unbiased, fair, and equal views so dangerous perspectives are not reinforced or created.",A chatbot should never give suggestions like violence or personal harm as solutions to something
generation93,Allowing customers to modify their customization options gives for a more personalized experience while protecting their privacy,"Before accessing personal data and offering personalized replies, chatbots should ask for permission","Chatbots should refrain from participating in debates or acts that encourage harmful conduct, prejudice, or disinformation","Chatbots should refrain from participating in debates or acts that encourage harmful conduct, prejudice, or disinformation"
generation94,People may not want personal particulars of their lives to be stored in a chatbot's memory,,,
generation95,,,you cannot get accurate info from mainstream news and governments,
generation96,it will harm the privacy of others,,it could also lead to misinformation,
generation97,"On the other hand, there are privacy concerns",Users should have the choice as to whether they want personalized answers or not,as well as data accuracy to consider,"There are many considerations here in terms of mental health status, dependency on technology, isolation, vulnerability of users"
generation98,at the cost of potential privacy concerns,"User control: Users should have the ability to adjust personalization levels, providing a spectrum of personalized or generic responses to suit their preferences","bias Mitigation: The rules address the critical issue of algorithmic bias, ensuring that personalization algorithms are regularly audited and bias is actively mitigated",Preventing harm and Promoting Well-Being
generation99,it can also introduce concerns like privacy issues,be given control over the extent of personalization in conversations involving sensitive or triggering topics,,"Chatbots should be programmed to recognize signs of distress, refrain from personalization when users express emotional instability, and provide immediate access to crisis helplines or mental health services"
generation100,Our personalized thoughts and words should not be out there on the web for any reason,,,
