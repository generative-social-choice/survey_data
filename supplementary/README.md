# Supplementary: Hand Annotated Chatbot Personalization Data 

As part of a supplementary exploratory qualitative analysis, we hand-annotated the 100 `generation` samples from our chatboat personalization dataset to measure the prevalence of four kinds of concerns: **privacy**, **choice**, **accuracy**, and **harm**. Each row corresponds to a participant, and the columns contain excerpts from the participants's response that raise the corresponding concern (if applicable, otherwise, the entry is left blank). 


Detailed description of columns:

* **privacy**: user is motivated by privacy, data security, data misuse
* **choice**: the user suggests opt-in, opt-out, or controls on what is retained and how much personalization happens
* **accuracy**: the user is concerned about information being false, biased, or misleading. This does not include concerns about a user only seeing information in their echo bubble.
* **harm**: the user is concerned with the risk that information could cause immediate harm, either because the information is false in an important domain like healthcare, or because the chatbot supports the user in harmful behavior (e.g., violence, terrorism, self harm)
