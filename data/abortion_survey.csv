<p><strong>How often do think about abortion or discuss it with others?</strong> How does this topic make you feel?</p>
<p><em>(Please write</em> <strong>two</strong> <em>or more sentences.)</em></p>",,,,,"I don't know that I think about or discuss it very often, though I certainly have done more of both since Roe v. Wade was overturned. Anyone around me with whom I would discuss it has the same views as I do---that it's free access is vital, that it is an issue of bodily autonomy that should not be interfered with by the state, that is it is not immoral or criminal, and that the life (both in terms of being alive, but also living a life that one wants) of an adult woman is vastly more important than the life or ""rights"" of a fetus. So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't discuss it much with those around me because there isn't much to say other than lamenting the injustice of having that right taken away from women. The idea of abortion, the act itself, does not bother me in the least. I've never had one, but I would not hesitate to do so were I to find myself pregnant as I do not want to have children. I would not feel bad about it, I would not mourn the unborn fetus, I would not agonize over the choice. I would treat it as I would, emotionally, any other medical intervention. The debate around it, however, makes me incredibly angry. Irate. Because the restrictions on it exist almost purely to control the lives of women, no matter how it is couched (generally in terms of religious objection). It is just a glaring example of the lack of respect for women's autonomy, for their position in the world as fully realized people and citizens. It is used to keep them in a position of subordinance, to oppress. Without access to abortion women will never truly be free to live in an actualized way.  ",2024-08-08,generation

<p><em>(Please write</em> <strong>two</strong> <em>or more sentences.)</em></p>",,,,,"Legal, without a doubt. It's illegality is baffling in the modern secular world. My answer does not depend on any circumstances at all: if a person wants an abortion they should be able to get one, full stop. Once the fetus becomes developed enough to be viable outside the womb---viable in the sense of being able to grow and thrive, not just survive while hooked to all amalgamation of tubes and contraptions---things certainly become murky. But my inclination will always be towards its full access and legality. If a person does not want to birth a child they should not be forced to.",2024-08-08,generation

The idea that someone can delineate to me exactly what decisions I am allowed to make concerning the only thing that is truly mine---my body, my corporeal self---is an anathema to me. I cannot stand it, it makes me want grit my teeth into dust, it makes me so angry. No man would consent to the amount of restrictions placed upon a woman's autonomy, both as it existed in the past and in today's world. Any person who does not believe in the free access of abortion to women does not believe women are fully-formed, thinking, feeling, breathing creatures just as themselves.

Abortion is appropriate in basically any situation in which a woman has decided she needs one. However,  as I said in another answer things do become more ethically ambiguous once the fetus is developed to such a degree as to basically be what be what we as a society consider an infant. As a person who believes in the rights of the child in an actual way (not in the way that those who oppose abortion will wield this point to act as evidence of their moral righteousness) then I must concede that at some point the fetus becomes a person, and a person has rights. But I think a woman's right to abortion should supersede that of a fetus is most scenarios.

The idea that pregnancy and birth is easy and safe, especially in a country like the United States which has such a high maternal mortality rate compared to other developed nations, is laughable.

I rarely discuss my pro-abortion views with my family because they already know I don't want kids and most of them don't feel that strongly about abortion either way.

I understand some of the pro-life talking points, but it just doesn't make sense to try and revert back to those dangerous methods because they want a baby to potentially be born. One of the pro-life points they always make is that a baby can be put up for adoption, with some pro-life people arguing that they would take and raise a baby if a pro-choice person had it, or something like that.

I am incredibly grateful for these options but also feel increasingly sad for those who cannot afford to move or have little access to women's healthcare. I discuss this topic with friends often as the growing limitations surrounding abortion and other healthcare like gender-affirming hormones make me angry. It feels very frustrating that the government has a say in how people live within their bodies. I am angry for all those who have been forced to carry to term against their will and I believe abortion, especially in the first trimester, should be a protected right for all those with the ability to get pregnant.

<p><strong>Do you think abortion should be legal or illegal?</strong> Which circumstances does your answer depend on?</p>
<p><em>(Please write</em> <strong>two</strong> <em>or more sentences.)</em></p>",,,,,"As I stated in the first question, I absolutely believe abortion should be legal and a protected right. I believe all women and those with the potential to carry should have the ability to choose whether or not they are willing to provide their body, their time, and their lives to a baby. Pregnancy is a beautiful thing, but so is choice. I feel many pro-life advocates fail to recognize the impact of creating something entirely dependent on you. They also fail to see how much damage growing up in a home where a parent did not want them can do to a child. I think that abortions past 24 weeks should not necessarily be illegal - late-term abortion can become a necessity for women whose lives are endangered by their pregnancy. I am not a doctor, but I believe after 24 weeks, depending on medical research, abortion should become a case-by-case basis.",2024-08-08,generation

<p><em>(Please write</em> <strong>two</strong> <em>or more sentences.)</em></p>",,,,,"I grew up in a very liberal city in the Bay Area of California, which greatly influenced how I view social issues. My parents taught me to be accepting of those who are different than myself and to reach for empathy before judgment. Many of my friends have expressed fear of pregnancy and the overwhelming idea of having to raise a human being for a minimum of eighteen years. I know people who have sought abortion and the relief they feel being rid of a life-altering responsibility they are not prepared for is one of the reasons I believe having options is important. Reading news stories of teenagers and women with health issues being forced through dangerous, painful pregnancies has also had a massive impact on my opinion. ",2024-08-08,generation

<p><strong>Can you describe a situation where you are not sure if abortion is appropriate or not?</strong> If so, what makes this situation borderline or unclear?</p>
<p><em>(Please write</em> <strong>two</strong> <em>or more sentences.)</em></p>",,,,,"After the 24-week mark, the possibility of abortion becomes dicey due to the procedure being more complex than early-stage abortions and the danger that they can pose to both the baby and mother. It is also when abortion becomes more of an ethical/moral dilemma for me as it is when the baby has a chance of survival outside of the womb. Though the chance for survival at 24 weeks is slim, passing that mark is when the fetus has developed enough to stand a chance on its own. I think late-term abortion really should be looked at case-by-case. Abortions before 24 weeks have no moral dilemma for me as there is only the mother whose life is on the line - I do not think late-term abortion should be illegal due to fetal anomalies/endangerment to the mother and child, but I think they should be infrequent and only performed on necessity.

Emphasizing adoption as a choice is important - it is an equally viable option for women who are not ready to raise a child. However, the foster care system and politics surrounding adoption in the United States are greatly flawed and should not be taken lightly. Many see abortion as the rash choice, the violent choice, but allowing a child to grow up unwanted, in potentially abusive situations, or as a means to an end through stipends or privatization is equally violent and cruel. Children should never grow up feeling unwanted and the potential for them to be harmed when born from an unwanted pregnancy is much greater. ",2024-08-08,generation

In addition, I disagree with adoption being a viable alternative since there are already numerous children through the adoption system who struggle with mental health and finding a family who accepts them. What would fully represent my viewpoint would require changing all sentences to something along the lines of, ""Abortion should be legal because fetuses are not legally recognized as people and cannot be killed.

Contraception and sex education would help lower the need for abortion.""",2024-08-08,generation

I believe that a person has plenty of time to find out they are pregnant and make a thoughtful decision about how they want to go forward before the baby would be viable. I strongly do not believe that people should NOT be able to put of the decision until the baby could survive without the parent.

<p><strong>How often do think about abortion or discuss it with others?</strong> How does this topic make you feel?</p>
<p><em>(Please write</em> <strong>two</strong> <em>or more sentences.)</em></p>",,,,,"I think about the topic of abortion quite a bit more than I used to. I would say that it would come up with others twice a week. It is an extremely delicate topic, and I notice that whenever it is brought up, I tend to shy away from it as much as the other individual. I feel perplexed, concerned with the moral aspect, and my religious views on it with regard to the importance of separation of church and state. ",2024-08-08,generation
generation56,4,text,"<h3>Background Questions</h3>
<p><strong>Do you think abortion should be legal or illegal?</strong> Which circumstances does your answer depend on?</p>
<p><em>(Please write</em> <strong>two</strong> <em>or more sentences.)</em></p>",,,,,"I believe it should be legal. I have come to this conclusion as a result of many factors that I will soon explain but at the heart of it I see abortion as a moral grey zone. Abortion technically should not be legal in many cases such as when an individual knows and understands that they can become pregnant but do not have the decency to try to prevent it. They then use abortion as a get out of it quick situation. I believe this is wrong on the moral level and degrades society to some degree with the relaxed view regarding taking an unborn child's life. 

You may wonder why I say that it should be legal in this case. My answer is that there are far too many complicated situations that arise due to life in general that will unfortunately necessitate it. In cases of rape, the individual that was raped should not have to reward the rapist with a child as a result of a horrendous crime against humanity. I understand it is an unborn child, however it was not conceived in a mutual way. If the person raped chooses to have the child, I believe it is completely up to them but the opening to abort the fetus at that point is absolutely understandable. Then there is the situation of birth defects and severe genetic issues that may warrant an abortion to simply prevent suffering of the unborn child that would be cruel and tragic if the child were to be born. This is a horrible fact of life, but parents should be able to abort a pregnancy if they believe that a I child would suffer throughout their life and not be able to live one that is fulfilling. As technology gets better it will happen less often and that is really the best we can hope for in this situation.  Abortion due to economic inability is horrible but we have no better solution to that yet. 

It ultimately comes down to a grey zone of necessity and compassion in conflict with morality and obligation. I do not believe that a woman should simply be able to have a child aborted simply because she feels like it. Doing so to hurt a man that wanted to have a child with her out of spite would be completely wrong from a moral and ethical standpoint. My decision to seek for it to be legal is because I understand that there are many more situations that may be helped with its legality than situations where it would create harm.",2024-08-08,generation

I was born in a very Christian family and went to a Christian school my entire life. I entered a public university and spent around three years in college.

Adoption being an option would need for there to be enough prospective adoptive parents out there to actually care for all of the children born into the world forcibly. Adoption is incredibly expensive, and something that is only afforded to very few as a real, honest choice. Adopted children, such as my mother, are often also left with lifelong mental issues that stem from the inherent abandonment of being adopted out, and in turn can make incredibly terrible parents and people in general. Adoption does not remove the physical and emotional damage to a mother caused by giving birth. Women, especially women of color, are at risk of DEATH when giving birth, as well as life long complications. It is entirely possible that being forced to carry an unwanted pregnancy could damage a woman internally to the point that she is not able to have another child when she is ready. A woman who is forced to carry a pregnancy that stems from sexual assault may be damaged for life emotionally and never get past the trauma. A woman who is ready for a child, who has a fetus inside of her that is born without a brain and only a brainstem that will die shortly after birth, who is forced to carry this child to term, would be scarred for life by the emotional toll of feeling their very loved and very wanted baby in their arms slowly wither and die. There are so many other equally horrific birth defects that leave a child to live minutes, hours, days, weeks, or months at most, that will forever scar a parent and potentially keep them from ever having another child or having a happy life. It is a cruel, thoughtless position to force women to carry a child to term that they are not ready for, because it involves divorcing yourself from the reality that a woman is not a broodmare, and instead a human being who is ALSO a life worth cherishing and protecting.

Hormonal issues, birth control failure, and other reasons can cause someone to not realize they are pregnant past the first trimester. I was 4.5 months pregnant before I realized, because my birth control - which keeps me from having a period - had failed and I wasn't aware. If I was a drinker, this scenario would have forced me to give birth to a child that likely had fetal alcohol syndrome or another birth defect, and would force that fate upon other innocent women, and leave thousands of disabled children with parents who resent them or no family at all. Disabled children are not adopted readily. It also does not state in this what ""exceptional circumstances"" is.

It affects me quite closely, seeing as I am a woman, who is very scared of pregnancy. I do not want to be pregnant or give birth. But thankfully I live in a state where abortion rights are protected (for now). But the possibility of that changing, is something I talk about with my family.

<p><strong>Where do your beliefs about abortion come from?</strong> For example, did particular life experiences influence your beliefs?</p>
<p><em>(Please write</em> <strong>two</strong> <em>or more sentences.)</em></p>",,,,,"My beliefs on abortion come from stories of women dying or almost dying giving birth, millions upon millions of women's bodies irreversibly damaged from giving birth (incontinence issues, 3rd degree tearing, pelvic floor issues, gestational diabetes that doesn't go away after birth, etc), not to mention the mental health issues that can arise, such as post- and pre-partum depression, post- and pre-partum anxiety and psychosis, due to the high amount of hormones and mental changes that go into creating a child within one's body. In addition, I couldn't image the mental anguish and physical pain a woman would have to go through being pregnant and giving birth when she didn't want to. Regular, wanted births can cause PTSD. Birth is a traumatic medical event. To force that on someone unwilling is akin to cruel and unusual punishment that is outlawed for use on prisoners.

Also, if a psychologist says that a woman was raped and it would be traumatic to carry to term, maybe in that case it would be necessary.

She is responsible for her condition and now has another life to think about. She could just have easily used contraception that is covered by insurance and easy to get.
